# Authors: Kidus Teshome, Cian Wilson
# 
# In the following pages we implement a global suite of subduction zone models assuming a steady state solution for temperature and a dislocation creep rheology.

# ```{admonition} Resolution
# In all cases the default resolution is low to allow for a quick runtime and smaller website size.  If sufficient computational resources are available set a lower `resscale` to get higher resolutions and results with sufficient accuracy.
