    "Repeating the numerical experiments with increasing `ne` allows us to test the **convergence** of our approximate finite element solution to the known analytical solution.  A key feature of any discretization technique is that with an increasing number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) these solutions should converge, i.e. the error in our approximation should decrease.

    "The rate at which this decreases is known as the order of convergence. Numerical analysis predicts a certain order depending on the type of the polynomials used as finite element shape functions and other constraints related to the well-posedness of the problem. For piecewise linear shape functions we expect second-order convergence, that is that the error decreases as $h^{-2}$ where $h$ is the nodal point spacing. With piecewise quadratic elements we expect to see third-order convergence."
